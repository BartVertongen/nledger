### .Net Ledger - Continuous Integration Build Log

This is a log with NLedger CI Builds results. CI builds reflect
any modifications in the current development branch and detect
potential issues in them. They follow the standard build
procedure as it is specified in NLedgerBuild.proj file (compile,
test and build a package) except running NLTest.
 
Every log record provides general information about the build
(status, date, modification description), link to a zip archive
with build logs (NLedger-BuildLogs-vN.N.Build.N.zip) and
the package itself (NLedger-vN.N.Build.N.zip). Use MD5 hashes
to identify binary files in case you do not trust Dropbox.

Used build environment is VSTS hosted agent; 
the latest build status is:
